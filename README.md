# Problem-Roulette
This project focuses on the student study behavior on Problem Roulette, a platform for students practicing before exams.
I focused on how studying sessions influences student performance.
Summary:
As a practice tool, PR plays a role helping students figure out what topics they have not yet understood. Students can focus more energy on those topics.
Statistical behaviors of session types across subjects are similar, but the overall volume of study is different.
Students who expend more energy studying gain better grades in classes; more sessions and/or longer average study sessions lead to better grade performance. 
Students do not want to waste energy on answering repetitive questions.
